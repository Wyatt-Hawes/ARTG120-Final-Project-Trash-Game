- A game that was made in collaboration with three other teammates with varying skill sets.
- We worked through the challenge of learning an entirely new game
engine and programming language.
- Managed a production timeline which included storyboarding, prototyping, task delegation, 
and weekly progress reports.
- The entire project was made in three weeks.
- In the project, I was a Programmer. I was responsible for the UI/UX, Mechanics, Level and Upgrade Design, and Debugging.

Congratulations! You've been hired as the city's newest sanitation specialist. The city was desperate for new sanitation workers, so they are paying you pretty well!
All you have to do is keep the city clean at night, how hard could it be?


Welcome to your new job! Here's some training on how to get started:

Controls:
---

WASD or ARROW KEYS to move
Q  -  place trash cans
E  -  pickup trash from trash cans
E  -  dump trash into the dumpster
E  -  pickup empty trash cans
Run into trash monsters -  pick them up

- This is a tower defense game where your objective is to keep the city safe. If the city is at 0 HP, you become overwhelmed and quit - game over!

- Place trash cans in front of monsters, or run into them to collect them.
  
- When your player is full, dump your trash into the dumpster. Then, rinse and repeat the process until the night ends. 

- In the day, you are able to get certain upgrades that will aid you in your job! Once you're ready, you can delve back into the night shift again.
