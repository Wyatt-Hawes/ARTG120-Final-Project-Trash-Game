#### '''[Playable Link](https://metatoshi.itch.io/disposable)'''

A game that was made in collaboration with three other teammates as 
we worked through the challenge of learning an entirely new game 
engine and programming language all while managing a production 
timeline which included storyboarding, prototyping, task deligation, 
and weekly progress reports. The entire project was made in three weeks.
